# Study Circle
Study Circle is a mobile app designed to help students connect with classmates and find study partners or project teammates. 

With a Tinder-style swiping system, students can quickly find and match with others in the same courses who are also looking for study groups or project teams.

The app provides a simple way for users to create a profile, select their enrolled classes, and start swiping through potential study partners. If two students swipe right on each other, they get matched and can start chatting right away!
